WMTS 1.0 schemas are included as local resources to work around discrepancies 
in wmtsGetCapabilities_response.xsd in element name="TileMatrixLimits" where 
the min and max tile row and column are of type positiveInteger; they should 
be nonNegativeInteger because 0 values are allowed in call cases per the 
documentation and the WMTS specification.

The local version of wmtsGetCapabilities_response.xsd has been modified to correct this error.  

These schemas should be removed from the WMTS ETS once the schemas at 
http://schemas.opengis.net/wmts/ have been corrected.
